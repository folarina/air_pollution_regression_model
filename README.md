# air_pollution_regression_mode

Since the start of the pandemic, I have been forced to keep a close eye on my asthma. I have had it my whole life, but I played little to no attention to it.

The data scientist within me wanted to know the pollution level of my local area.

I decided to create a regression model based upon the air pollution levels of my local high street. 

Itâ€™s an interesting topic and I will likely comeback to it in the near future.
